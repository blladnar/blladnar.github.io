<p>My name is Randall Brown, and I'm a software developer. I am also hiking from Mexico to Canada along the Pacific Crest Trail.
I first started backpacking about 4 years ago shortly after moving to Seattle from Michigan (Go Blue!) Ever since then, I've tried to make my trips bigger and longer. Until hiking the PCT, my longest trip was 8 days on the Wonderland Trail.</p>

<p>This blog is going to follow my progress along the trail. I hope you enjoy following me on my journey.</p>
