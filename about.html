<p>My name is Randall Brown, and I make iPhone apps. I also am hiking from Mexico to Canada along the Pacific Crest Trail.
I first started backpacking about 4 years ago shortly after moving to Seattle from Michigan (Go Blue!) Ever since then, I've tried to make my trips bigger and longer.</p>

<p>This blog is going to follow my progress along the trail. I hope you enjoy following along on my journey.</p>
