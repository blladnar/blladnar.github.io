After listening to bugling elk all night long I got to hiking. After 5 days of easy backpacking I was ready to put in some miles. Unfortunately a fire closed the trail after about 25 miles.

The day brought me through Mt. Rainier National Park, my 6th national park of the trip. The trail just barely skirts the edge of the park, but still provides some great views of the mountain.

After passing a few nice lakes, I made it to Chinook Pass where the trail closed. You could see the fire burning just over the ridge. It looked like it was away from the trail but apparently it has crossed the trail and even threatens the Crystal Mountain Ski Area. The trail is closed for about 20 miles and I had to hitchhike around it.

I got a ride from a couple who lived in nearby Greenwater and they dropped me off at a forest road where I saw a handful of hikers that I knew. From there we got another ride from a guy going for a weekend ORV trip. We sat in the back of his pickup and drank beers that he gave us. 

I didn't get much hiking in after that, but my total miles hiked for the day ended up being around 30 miles. With the skipping, it made for a 50 mile day. I wish all 50s were that easy.

This fire below isn't actually the one closing the trail, but I'm pretty sure it's the one that filled the Enchantments with smoke for us a few days before.
