The canyon we camped in happened to be full of condensation for the night, soaking our sleeping bags as we slept. We packed up and headed for town. Hiker Heaven was close.

First though, I ran into the trail angel Coppertone again. He gave me some fresh fruit and cinnamon rolls for breakfast. Even on a day I'm going into town, trail magic is awesome and appreciated.

After many miles of the similar looking rocks and mountains, we passed through an interesting place called Vasquez Rocks. It's a set of unusual rock formations where layers of the ground have tilted, forming large overhanging structures. Its proximity to Hollywood makes it a common setting for movies like Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey and Blazing Saddles.

After the rocks, the PCT joins a paved road into Agua Dulce. We stopped at the Sweetwater Bar and Grill for breakfast. While we were there a guy offered us a ride to Hiker Heaven in his Gator. Five of us piled in the back and we headed out.

Hiker Heaven is just someone's house that is set up to allow thru hikers to stay there, but it's also an amazing place. Their garage is set up like a post office, with lots of people receiving and shipping packages. They provide free laundry, that they do for you. They also provide internet, charging stations, water, places to camp, and more.

After setting out our stuff to dry, we started relaxing. We got out of the sun, drank cold drinks, and even watched some basketball on TV. I was also able to find and patch a hole in my sleeping pad, using a kiddie pool they have just for that purpose. After spending the night, we took a shuttle to a nearby REI and I was able to exchange my tent, since the zipper ripped and buy groceries for much cheaper than most small towns charge.

It was a restful couple of days, but we decided it was time to leave. We waited out the heat and began our hike for the day around 5:30 PM.

We hiked until 11 PM, climbing up and away from Agua Dulce and back into the mountains.
