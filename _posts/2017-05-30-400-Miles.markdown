After a long climb up Mt Baden Powell, we were tired. The trail doesn't care. We started the day with another steep climb up Mt Williamson. The summit was a little off trail, but I dropped my pack and bagged another peak.

Next up was a road walk along highway 2. This section of the trail is closed because it's the habitat of an endangered frog. The alternate route involved a few miles of road walking followed by a trail from a nearby campground. At this point Amit and I diverged from the group and did the trail, while a few others continued on the road until it met back up with the PCT. I figured I came out here to hike on a trail, not a road, even though the way I went was 1 mile longer than the actual trail.

On the alternate, we ran into a few other hikers we've seen the past few days. One guy still hasn't gone to the bathroom in a hole in the ground.

Shortly after the alternate route reconnected with the PCT, we hit mile 400. Every hundred miles seems to come a little bit faster.

After mile 400, we hiked on to mile 411 to meet up with our friends who walked the road. That made for 28 trail miles, my longest day so far. With the added mile of alternate hiking and my summit excursion, I probably hiked 30 miles today.
