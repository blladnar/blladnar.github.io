After all the trouble finding camp last night, we wanted to get an early start so we could outhike the herd. Today would be a day with mostly climbing. Luckily it was less climbing than the day before and waaaay less descending. 

After an initial flat area, we began a long 3000 foot climb to the top of a ridge. We had an amazing view of Mt Adams. I was able to clearly see the climbing route and southwest chutes. 

Further along the ridge we had views of Mt St Helens and Mt Hood. Eventually we entered the Indian Heaven Wilderness. It's an area of Washington I've wanted to explore for awhile,  it never made it down here because it's pretty far from Seattle.

Indian Heaven has a reputation for really bad mosquitoes, so it was nice when we didn't have any issues with them while hiking.

We stopped for a short break about 28 miles into the day at Blue Lake when another hiker came up behind us. He had camped in the mayhem last night and said he though most of those people would be coming there. It was still pretty early and we decided to hike the 3 extra miles to Bear Lake.

The mosquitoes were a little worse here, but not unbearable. I still haven't worn any of the deet I've been carrying for several hundred miles. I'm okay with that.

Tomorrow will take us to the base of Mt. Adams.
