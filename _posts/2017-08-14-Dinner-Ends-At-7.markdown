34 miles from our campsite is the Shelter Cove Resort. They serve food and have a general store. Getting to a restaurant is always exciting, but they closed at 7 and we had 34 miles to go. No problem.

After being outhiked by everyone yesterday, I tried to wake up early so I wouldn't be the last person there. I got up a little early, but not enough to beat everyone to Shelter Cove.

The smoke and clouds from the day before were gone but the weather stayed cold. This made for excellent hiking and excellent views. Oregon has a lot of big volcanoes and we got to see a few today.

There's not a lot of water around here, but luckily the heavy snow year and the tall volcanoes gives us a few more streams than normal. We also had to cross a pretty large snow patch today at mile 1894.

I really only took one break today, but somehow everyone I was with managed to pass me. I still did 35 miles before 6 pm (34 plus the mile to Shelter Cove) so I'm not too disappointed.

The food was good and there were a ton of hikers. A few people I started with hitched up and pulled up right when I arrived. Unfortunately, there's another fire in Oregon and we're going to have to do some alternate routes. It sucks because we'll miss the Three Sisters Wilderness which was one of the parts of Oregon I was looking forward to the most. That's life on the trail I suppose.
