The Pacific Crest Trail Association requires a thru hiking permit for hikes over 500 miles. Today, that permit finally became necessary for me.

After leaving Casa De Luna and night hiking to the top of the mountain, we got an early start and hiked down as the sun rose. Our goal for the morning was water about 14 miles away. It was at what looked like an abandoned campground.

For whatever reason, there were a ton of flies today. I used my bug head net for the first time today and during our break, everyone set up our tents to get away from the bugs.

After eating lunch, we all took naps and slept away most of mid day heat. Then it was time to hike. We wanted to get about 10 miles away from a place called Hiker Town where we are going to siesta tomorrow.

Not long after leaving the campground, we passed the 500 mile mark and took photos. Then we headed to the campsite. It's the first night in awhile we haven't night hiked, so it's nice to get to bed early. On the trail, they say hiker midnight is about 8 pm. It's definitely hard to make it much past that.
