After sleeping in until about 7:30, I enjoyed the cell phone service I had at our campsite. I decided to burn through whatever battery I had left and trust that VVR would have somewhere to charge my phone. (They did.)

We got on the ferry (more like fishing boat) at about 9:30 AM and got to the resort in time for breakfast. I ordered the steak and eggs and it was amazing. I followed that up with some ice cream while we waited for lunch to start.

Funnily enough, there wasn't cell phone service at the resort. It was just out on the lake near where we were camped. Instead of figuring out how I could get back to Michigan for a wedding I just hung out with other hikers and ate food. It was pretty relaxing.

VVR had a nice system where you opened a tab and they ran your credit card once at the end. This was because they charged a $2.00 fee. It kinda felt like I was at a fancy hotel. 

After our lunch of fried chicken üçó, we got back on the boat and headed to the trail. There are several hairy creek crossings right after VVR and I wanted to get them out of the way. What I didn't realize was that once you did them, you were fairly committed to the next pass. What I mean by that is, the last crossing was on a very steep cliff under a waterfall. You had to go to the top of the cliff after you crossed.

So we climbed up and up, getting well above the snow line and had very few options for camping. So here I am, tent poorly pitched on a slanted rock, on a cold snowy pass.

Today was a great day, and even though this campsite isn't ideal, it has an amazing view. I might be a bit cold tonight, but at least I don't have to walk under that waterfall at 7 in the morning like the people who camped earlier.
