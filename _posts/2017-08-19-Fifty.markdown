Waking up at 3 in the morning to go hiking is tough, but that's what we did. We were on trail at about 3:50 am and had done about 20 miles by 10 am. After that we would break it into 10 mile chunks, taking breaks in between.

You know what you don't do very much of when you're trying to hike 50 miles in a day? Take pictures. This is one of the only pictures I took today.

We walked by Timothy Lake, which seems like an extremely popular place to camp and boat. There were a lot of hike in/boat in spots. Most of them were full.

We took a dinner break after doing 40 miles at a trailhead. While I was cooking, a lady offered me a sandwich and some cheese. I also ate my normal dinner of Knorr Rice Sides.

The thing with the last 10 miles is that they were mostly uphill. Oh yeah, also it got dark at 8:30 so we had to do some night hiking. We stopped just short of Timberline Lodge at a campsite with an amazing looking view of Mt. Hood.

This was a really hard day and I'm glad I was able to pull it off. I don't really think I'll be doing it again.
