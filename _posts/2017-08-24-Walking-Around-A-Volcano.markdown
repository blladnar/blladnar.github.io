In the morning, a fog had rolled over the lake and covered the trees. Somehow, my tent wasn't wet. As I walked through the woods, water would drop off the trees. In the open, it was fine.

About a mile into the hike I heard a loud crashing sound. I thought I was finally going to see a bear, then it looked like a really big deer. It was an elk. Then I heard what sounded like thunder. An entire herd of elk went pounding through the forest in front of me. It was quite the experience.

As the day wore on, the fog cleared and it became a pretty nice day. We started getting views of Mt. Adams and it was amazing how close we were. We crossed a road that gives access to the nearby town of Trout Lake. Someone had left a large bearproof trash can full of food for hikers. There was even chocolate milk! We ate lunch and enjoyed the snacks before moving on.

We began a long climb up to the base of Mt. Adams. We started walking around it, seeing the southwest chutes and pikers peak. As we got closer we went further north. A large burn area obscured our views but finally we left the burn and found a great campsite with an amazing view.
