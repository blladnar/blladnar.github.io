After our failed attempt to get out of the wind, we woke just before the sunrise and got ready to head out. Today's goal was a McDonald's, right next to the trail.

We started climbing up and around Silverwood Lake, a reservoir that was full of boats on the holiday weekend. We also got some early morning trail magic in the form of bananas, strawberries, and cupcakes in a cooler hidden along the trail.

Next we continued past powerlines and near campgrounds, bustling with activity. We climbed and climbed until finally the ground kind of just dropped away.

There was a dramatic view of the valley below and a highway that would be our goal for the day. It was all downhill to McDonald's, the only catch was no water.

We hiked and hiked, eventually running out of water just before we saw the official trail sign pointing to McDonald's (yes, it says McDonald's on a forest service trail sign.) We did 21 miles by 2:30 pm.

Upon arrival, we found the restaurant filled with dirty, gross, smelly hikers. All the normal customers wore confused looks on their faces as we all scarfed down food and charged our phones.

I sat in the McDonald's for 4 hours eating McNuggets and making a Dr. Pepper float. I also had an apple pie and the main event, a milkshake.

When more hikers arrived, we headed back to the trail. We managed to do 5 more miles before dark and camped in the bottom of a valley, looking up at the stars.

Side note: I left my flip flops at McDonald's. I'm really hoping someone picks them up.
