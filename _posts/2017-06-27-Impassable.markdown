Today was almost all about one thing. Bear Creek. Sure, we had to climb Selden pass and cross countless other small streams, but Bear Creek stuck out. Why? Since before I even started the PCT people have been saying that Bear Creek is impassable. Hundreds of people are skipping ahead and hiking south or road walking around, just bedause of this creek.

Today, I crossed that creek. It was't impassable, it was actually pretty easy. We hiked upstream and crossed two tributaries separately. It probably added an hour to our hiking. We crossed directly below this waterfall.

After that crossing, a huge weight was lifted off of me. Getting to Canada feels like a when, not an if. It's all possible now. We carried 8 days worth of food because people said this section was so hard. We did it in 5.

When we were done with the crossing, we kept hiking, pulling some of our biggest miles in the Sierras. We wanted to get to VVR (Vermillion Valley Resort) for some food and drinks.

The resort is on one end of a lake and the PCT is on the other. A ferry will take you from the trail to the resort.

We missed the last ferry of the day, but we'll catch one in the morning. Until then, I've been eating all my extra food and enjoying the scenery.
