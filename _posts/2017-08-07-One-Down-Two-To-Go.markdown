Today was my last day in California. I've been there almost 3 months. I wonder how long before I would have become a resident. I slept really well last night and was ready to take on the day. My shoes felt a little better than the day before, and I was ready to get the hell out of California.

After a few hours I stopped for some water and met my first real Southbounders. They started in Canada, but skipped almost all of Oregon. We talked a bit about the trail in Washington and I gave them some info about the upcoming trail.

The border is pretty anticlimactic. There's a sign on a tree and a trail register. I signed it and saw that a ton of people crossed into Oregon today. Ashland might be pretty busy tomorrow.

I've been hearing about how easy Oregon is all trail. I'm really hoping this isn't some joke that everyone who has done the trail is in on. First thing out of California and into Oregon, the trail climbed over 1000 feet. It did flatten out after that, but it seemed like some kind of joke.

The scenery has changed a little. The mountains are a bit less mountainous, but other than that it looks the same. I'll be in Ashland tomorrow. I can't wait to take a shower and do laundry.
