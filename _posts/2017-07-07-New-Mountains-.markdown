After dinner last night we needed a place to camp. A bunch of us that the resort decided to head to the campground that was next door to find a site. Well, it was dark and we couldn't really find any open spots and we ended up just camping next to the road.

It wasn't until morning that I noticed the "No Trespassing" and "No Camping" signs next to where we camped. Oh well, we were out of there by 6 am anyway.

I went back to the resort and ordered a huge breakfast. Chicken fried steak and eggs with hash browns and toast, plus a stack of pancakes. They might have been the best pancakes I've had on trail.

After stuffing my face, I went to the store and bought my food to get me to South Lake Tahoe. It'll only be 3 days, so I won't have to bring much. I also got to mail my bear can home. It isn't required anymore and that makes my backpack so much lighter and easier to pack. I also sent home my ice axe and a few other odds and ends I won't need anymore. I felt like I could jog down the trail my pack was so light.

Once I was done with my "chores" I stuck around to wait for my friend Splash. He showed up just in time for breakfast. We hung out a bit before having lunch and then heading to the Saloon for a beer. We shared war stories about the creek crossings with some other hikers. Soon after, I decided it was time to get back on trail and Splash wanted to stay awhile longer. I hitched out while he stayed (presumably for dinner).

At the trailhead a man noticed I was hiking alone and asked if he could hike in with me. He was a bit older and clearly not a PCT hiker. I said he could, but I wasn't sure if our paces would be the same. He asked if I was slow and then said he was in great shape for an old guy and we started hiking. He also had a little chihuahua with him. 

About 10 minutes into the hike, he had fallen far enough behind that I couldn't see him anymore. About 30 minutes later I had to navigate some snow and rocks that I don't think that chihuahua could handle. Once I got to the top of the first climb I got cell phone service and I stopped to see what was going on in the world. After about half an hour, there was no sign of the man.

I was hoping for less snow in this section but as soon as I got over the top I knew it would be just like everywhere else. At least I got to go *down* the snowfield.

The trail was nowhere to be seen but it followed a river very closely, so that's what I did too. There were some good footprints to follow and I made good time. Of course, snow wasn't the only obstacle. I had to cross lots of little streams that fed into the river. This one was particularly fast moving.

This log was too slanted to walk on so I sat down and scooted across. I touched my poles into the water and found out the water was actually pretty shallow. It probably would have been easier to just walk through it.

As the day continued, the sun began to set and I had a great view of the canyon.

I only hiked about 9 miles today, but that should set me up nicely for 3 days to Lake Tahoe.
