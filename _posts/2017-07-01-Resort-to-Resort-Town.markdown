The morning started with a climb up Silver Pass.  It was easy going on firm snow with more great views. The way down got a little tricky. The trail was hard to follow and it ended up being a lot of bushwhacking, checking the map, and correcting.

Eventually, I made it down into the valley and stopped by the beautiful Purple Lake. After water and snacks, I started climbing again. The trail was pretty clear and I actually ran into a few hikers. First a guy on the JMT who told me how he had a long day with 10 miles and 2000 feet of elevation gain. He wanted to camp at purple lake. I didn't mention that I had gone 15 miles with 3000 feet of gain already. He seemed to think I wouldn't make it to Mammoth, another 10 miles.

I wasn't sure if I'd make it, but it was still early and I wanted a shower and a real bed, so I hiked on. I passed the 900 mile marker and stopped for another break. At this point I was pretty far ahead of my hiking partner, so I was trying to let him catch up.

As I got closer to Mammoth, there were more patches of snow. The trail was hard to follow again and my progress slowed. Eventually, I made it to the junction with the Mammoth Pass trail, the easiest way into Mammoth right now. Normally, you can catch a shuttle from the nearby Red's Meadow Resort, but the road is closed so I have to hike three miles on a side trail.

I hang out at the junction for a little while, enjoying the cell phone service that comes with being near a ski resort before I head on. The side trail is almost totally snow covered with hundreds of blown over trees. These aren't little trees you can just step over either. They're huge. I end up checking my phone every 2 or 3 minutes to make sure I'm going the right way. After over 2 hours, I make it to horseshoe lake.

Horseshoe Lake is part of the Mammoth Trails system and there were a ton of people even though I got there after 7. I sat down and waited for my friend but was quickly offered a ride. I decided I would head into town and get us a hotel room. I ended up booking the same hotel that Meghan and I stayed in when we were in Mammoth this past winter.

Around the time I was checked in and showered, I got a message from my friend that he had finally made it to the lake. He was going to camp there for the night since it was after dark and nobody was at the trailhead. I ordered Dominos and enjoyed having a hotel room to myself.
