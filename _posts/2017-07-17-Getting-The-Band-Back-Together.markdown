Hotel checkout was at 11 so I took full advantage of it. Room service for breakfast and some Netflix. Then I started hitching back to the trail. My plan was to walk a little bit outside of town to make sure the cars were going the right way. After about half an hour, I just called a Lyft. I was antsy to get hiking.

When I got to the trailhead I saw my old friend A-Team. We haven't seen each other since Tehachapi. I knew he was close by, but I thought I'd be catching up to him. A couple miles down the trail I saw Two Taps, another friend from Tehachapi. So our original Sierra group was almost back together.

We were lucky that the snow wasn't too bad today. Some patches, but nothing that made routefinding too hard. The goal for the day was Dick's Pass. It would be about 15 miles to the pass and a couple more to get out of the snow. 

That week off has definitely gotten me a little out of trail shape. I think today was the first day so far that my knees have hurt. I think my trail legs will be back quick.

Our group is pretty big at the moment. Quite a bit different than hiking with one person through the Sierra. It should be a fun change.
