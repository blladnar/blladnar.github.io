Today started with a 15 mile road walk into Crater Lake National Park. The fire burning south of the park had the PCT closed, so the highway was out only option. Walking on hard asphalt for that long killed my feet, but the rim trail was open, so we would have trail the rest of the day.

There were lots of hikers at Mazama Village. Everyone was so pumped about the trail being open.

Splash's parents were at Crater Lake and they bought us lunch and offered to take our packs up from Mazama Village to the rim. We happily let them and we slackpacked the 4 miles to get to the lake rim.

The smoke from the fires caused a little haze, but it still looked pretty good. We spent a pretty long time at the cafe on the rim and didn't get hiking until late. We decided to camp up at the fire lookout on the lake rim.

Not sure if we're allowed to, but there's no signs saying not to.
