				<p>After dinner last night we needed a place to camp. A bunch of us that the resort decided to head to the campground that was next door to find a site. Well, it was dark and we couldn’t really find any open spots and we ended up just camping next to the road.</p>

<p><img src="/img/New Mountains Post0.JPG" alt="photo0" /></p>

<p>It wasn’t until morning that I noticed the “No Trespassing” and “No Camping” signs next to where we camped. Oh well, we were out of there by 6 am anyway.</p>

<p>I went back to the resort and ordered a huge breakfast. Chicken fried steak and eggs with hash browns and toast, plus a stack of pancakes. They might have been the best pancakes I’ve had on trail.</p>

<p>After stuffing my face, I went to the store and bought my food to get me to South Lake Tahoe. It’ll only be 3 days, so I won’t have to bring much. I also got to mail my bear can home. It isn’t required anymore and that makes my backpack so much lighter and easier to pack. I also sent home my ice axe and a few other odds and ends I won’t need anymore. I felt like I could jog down the trail my pack was so light.</p>

<p>Once I was done with my “chores” I stuck around to wait for my friend Splash. He showed up just in time for breakfast. We hung out a bit before having lunch and then heading to the Saloon for a beer. We shared war stories about the creek crossings with some other hikers. Soon after, I decided it was time to get back on trail and Splash wanted to stay awhile longer. I hitched out while he stayed (presumably for dinner).</p>

<p>At the trailhead a man noticed I was hiking alone and asked if he could hike in with me. He was a bit older and clearly not a PCT hiker. I said he could, but I wasn’t sure if our paces would be the same. He asked if I was slow and then said he was in great shape for an old guy and we started hiking. He also had a little chihuahua with him.</p>

<p>About 10 minutes into the hike, he had fallen far enough behind that I couldn’t see him anymore. About 30 minutes later I had to navigate some snow and rocks that I don’t think that chihuahua could handle. Once I got to the top of the first climb I got cell phone service and I stopped to see what was going on in the world. After about half an hour, there was no sign of the man.</p>

<p>I was hoping for less snow in this section but as soon as I got over the top I knew it would be just like everywhere else. At least I got to go <em>down</em> the snowfield.</p>

<p><img src="/img/New Mountains Post1.JPG" alt="photo1" /></p>

<p>The trail was nowhere to be seen but it followed a river very closely, so that’s what I did too. There were some good footprints to follow and I made good time. Of course, snow wasn’t the only obstacle. I had to cross lots of little streams that fed into the river. This one was particularly fast moving.</p>

<p><img src="/img/New Mountains Post2.JPG" alt="photo2" /></p>

<p>This log was too slanted to walk on so I sat down and scooted across. I touched my poles into the water and found out the water was actually pretty shallow. It probably would have been easier to just walk through it.</p>

<p>As the day continued, the sun began to set and I had a great view of the canyon.</p>

<p>I only hiked about 9 miles today, but that should set me up nicely for 3 days to Lake Tahoe.</p>
