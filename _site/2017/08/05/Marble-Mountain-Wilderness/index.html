				<p>If the nearby wildfires are good for anything, it’s awesome sunrises. I started my hike this morning before the sun rose, but I got to see it rising as I got my first view of Marble Mountain. It was far away, but you could tell there was something different about it.</p>

<p><img src="/img/Marble Mountain Wilderness Post0.JPG" alt="photo0" /></p>

<p>As I got closer, I realized it was actually made of marble. I’m no geologist, but the rocks were white with a light grey “marbling” so I think that’s what it was. Pretty weird since none of the other mountains were made of it. I guess that’s what they named the wilderness after it.</p>

<p><img src="/img/Marble Mountain Wilderness Post1.JPG" alt="photo1" /></p>

<p>Quite a bit of snow today actually. This last patch was at 1625.3 but there were probably 5 or 6 patches in that mile. I told a Sobo (southbound hiker) that there was some snow coming up. I think I freaked her out a little.</p>

<p>Most of my morning I was climbing up and around Marble Mountain. When I finally reached the top I had a massive descent down to Seiad Valley, the next town stop. To get to town I would need to do 40 miles. I didn’t want to get in to such a small town in the middle of the night, so I opted for a campground that’s about 6.5 away from Seiad Valley. It’s actually where the trail ends for a bit too. The next 6.5 miles are along a road and then I’ll walk right through town.</p>

<p>The descent went down into one of the smoke filled valleys that surrounded me. There are several wildfires nearby (none threatening the PCT) and their smoke is a constant bother. It’s hard to tell in this picture just how much smoke there was. Luckily I was above it most of the day.</p>

<p><img src="/img/Marble Mountain Wilderness Post2.JPG" alt="photo2" /></p>

<p>The whole day I didn’t see any northbound hikers. I barely saw anyone else, period. That made my descent into the valley a bit more spooky. The valley had burned recently and it was filled with smoke/fog. It was like something out of a scary movie. At least it was daylight. Eventually, I got below the smoke, but the smoke seemed to be trapping in the moisture. It was ridiculously humid.</p>

<p>When I got to the campground I expected to see some hikers, but it was empty. Of course, the mosquitoes were out in force making it hard to relax at the end of such a hard day. I was hoping to talk strategy for tomorrow’s pancake challenge with some other hikers, but I guess I’m on my own. Just after I got in my tent, another person showed up. I guess I wasn’t the only one hiking today.</p>
